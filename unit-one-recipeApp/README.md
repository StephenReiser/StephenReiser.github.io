### Other Notes

This app is built using jQuery, CSS, and some HTML.  The majority of the functionality and content is created through jQuery.  Each recipe essentially has 3 cards - A picture, a list of ingredients, and a list of diet/health restrictions.

The main modal appears on load or if a search is invalid. The idea of the modal is to force the user to make an action.  Currently, this app loads 20 recipes at a time, this can be toggled via the code.


### Built With
All recipes are generated from the Edamam API.
