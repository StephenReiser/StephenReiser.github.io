/* Things to add:
1. Banner up top - would be cool to have it full screen on load and then shrink once activated - could do this as a modal but I don' tknow if I want to.
2. Probably could add calorie counts
3. would like to make image a link
4. include h3 tag on ingredient side of card.
5. Woudl be nice to have the div on flip to not change size to fit
6. everything is ugly - need to fix that, better h3 on the bottom, round edges perhaps. fonts/sizes
7. I think it would be good to either rank recipe options? or pick a random set to show? or something like that so it changes each time.
