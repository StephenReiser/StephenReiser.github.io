Recipe search allows users to search for recipes based on food items, diet restrictions and health restrictions </p>

It is built with MongoDB, Mongoose and Express on the backend and EJS/jQuery (as well as a bit of vanilla JS) on the front end.  This was my unit 2 project for GA.  It utilizes a 3rd party API which is queried via the npm request module.  It is filled with features such as maps, authentication, sessions, autocomplete, as well as some CSS toys such as the hamburger icon (on small screen sizes) and the carousel.  The ability to create, edit, and delete breweries is available to a admin user.  Typical users can view information about each brewery and then add comments if logged in</p>

                    <p>Built to help my wife narrow down food allergies, this app allows a user to log meals after you ate to help track patterns in what may or may not make you sick.  Built with React on the front end and Ruby on Rails and postgresql on the backend, this app comes with full authentication and dynamic updates.  Users can then go back and add comments and toggle if the meal made them sick or not.  A graph at the top as well as emojis help the user track their triggers.  Additional features include password reset, token authentication, a sudo password reset, as well as some helpers such as React Context.  This app is also built in React Native (see the next project) </p>
